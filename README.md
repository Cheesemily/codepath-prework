## Notes

Had trouble understanding the lingo to assign the button to the logic portion of xCode. Then I started playing around the screen including my keyboard and was able to implement the feature to add the UI to logic portion. Also, learning how to conenct github to my projects from my desktop. The youtube video from the prework website helped a lot.
